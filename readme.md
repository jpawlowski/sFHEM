# sFHEM - Secure FHEM Web Environment

sFHEM is a web environment to securely provide access to [FHEM](http://www.fhem.org/) and it's frontends.
It makes use of [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)'s [auth_request](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html) and [reverse proxy function](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/reverse-proxy/) in order to protect any possible backend application by providing rich web-based user single-sign-on mechanism in front of it.

sFHEM is based on the power of the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) PHP framework.
